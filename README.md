# Signal-Processing Project | DESPIN Lucas & FAGNONI Th√©o
In this git, we present our investigations on lymbic structure representation.
In particular, we base our work on the \underline{A deep learning toolbox for automatic segmentation of subcortical limbic structures from MRI images} article.
More precisely, we applied our segmentation tool to our own dataset, and proposed an analysis of the produced results.
